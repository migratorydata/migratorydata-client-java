This folder contains examples that show how to use MigratoryData Client SDK for Java.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or later

STRUCTURE
---------

This example has the following structure:

	- lib : folder containing the MigratoryData Client API for Java library
	
	- src : folder containing the source files of this example
	
	- build.bat : this is the build script for Windows; it allows rebuilding the 
	              "sample-client.jar" by compiling the sources of the "src" folder
	              
	- build.sh : this is the build script for Linux / Unix; it allows rebuilding 
	             the "sample-client.jar" by compiling the sources of the "src" folder
	             
	- sample-client.jar : the JAR binary of this example
		
	- README : this file

	- start.bat : the start-up script for Windows
	
	- start.sh : the start-up script for Linux / Unix

	- manifest.txt : it is used for building the JAR binary from sources

USAGE
-----

To use this example please follow these steps:

	1. Configure the start-up parameters for your operating system (Linux / Unix 
	   or Windows) by editing the script "start.sh" or "start.bat"
	   
	2. Start the MigratoryData server
		
	4. Start the example by using the start-up script
	
	4. Real-time messages and status notifications should appear in the console 

MODIFYING AND REBUILDING THE SOURCE CODE
----------------------------------------

	1. Edit the files in the "src" folder
	
	2. Run the "build.sh" or "build.bat" scripts (depending on your operating 
	   system) to rebuild the source code. If successful, the build will 
	   overwrite the "sample-client.jar" with a new JAR binary.
